# User-Styles
Custom Styling for Various Websites that I have created for increased convenience and to prevent my laptop screen from looking like vomit when I visit a particular site.

If you want to use this, you will need to use an extension like Stylish or Stylus. I personally recommend Stylus. https://github.com/openstyles
